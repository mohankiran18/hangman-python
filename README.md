# Hangman Game 

This is a simple Hangman game I made using Python. I’m not a coder, but I built it by learning step-by-step using ChatGPT and running the code in Google Colab.

##  What It Does
- Picks a random word from a list
- Lets you guess one letter at a time
- Shows your progress as you go
- You get 6 chances to make a wrong guess — after that, it’s game over!

## Why I Made This
I’ve always been curious about coding but never really knew where to start. So I decided to try building something small — and Hangman felt perfect.

I used ChatGPT to guide me through every step and ran it all in Google Colab. I didn’t write the code from scratch myself, but I understood how each part works, and that’s what really matters to me right now.

##  How to Play
1. Open the Python file in Google Colab (or any Python environment)
2. Run the code
3. Start typing letters to guess the word




Big thanks to ChatGPT for helping me learn and build this. I’m just getting started, but it feels awesome to create something that works.

## How to Run
1. Open the code in Google Colab or any Python editor
2. Run the code
3. Type your guesses as prompted
